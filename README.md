### O HAI! ヽ(´▽`)/
  
I do front-end stuff! Been a software engineer for almost 11 years now, basically an enthusiast of anything interesting, did a lot of work throughout the years with `Angular` and `Vue3` on the Front-End side, (and their companions: JS/TS, S/CSS, HTML) but I also very rarely do some work with some `Node.JS` (JS and TS, but prefer TS!) and `.NET` (because C# is superior), I'm also kinda experienced with cloud techs (AWS, OCI, Azure), containerization (Docker) and CI/CD (GH Actions and Jenkins).

Liked something I did and want to contribute somehow?

PS: If you're one of those low self-steem seniors that judges people by their contribution graph on GH, rest assured this profile is where I keep the fun happening, work is somewhere else - private and only work related. :-)
