### O HAI! ヽ(´▽`)/
  
I do front-end stuff! Been a software engineer for more than a decade now, I'm basically an enthusiast of anything interesting, did a lot of work throughout the years with `Angular` and `Vue` on the Front-End side, but I also very rarely do some work with some `Node.JS` (JS and TS, but prefer TS!) and `.NET` (because C# is superior), I'm also kinda experienced with cloud techs (AWS, OCI, Azure), containerization (Docker) and CI/CD (GH Actions and Jenkins).  
    
Liked something I did and want to contribute somehow?
